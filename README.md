# odin-recipes
My first project for the Odin Project!
As you can see from the upper line, this is my first time to actually build something with HTML.
In this project, i will create a recipe site with my basic HTML knowlegde and show you three of my lazy food recipes.
There is going to be a main page with three alt-page(?) to show
you all the recipes.
If i do everything correctly, this will show how i can create
a basic website that function with lists and alt-pages.
Secondly, this will be the project for me to get use to add, commit and push process of GitHub.
Overall, i'm looking forward to this, let's see how it goes.
